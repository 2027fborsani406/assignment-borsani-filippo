        <h1>My passions</h1>
        <p>Music: Music has always been a really important part of my life because of my mum and her love for singing. I started singing in my school choior at 10 years old and now I sing in a big choir in Milan. For my 16th birthday my parents bought me a keybord and I've been learning how to play since then.</p>

        <p>Art: The passion for art was born from my family as well; my dad an I always used to draw together when I was a kid and I've always loved doing it. When I had to choose which Hisgh School to go to I picked and art school and even if I changed to a science school I kept on drawing as an hobby.</p>
